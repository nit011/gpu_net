 ##Imports:
•	@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol - This imports the ERC20 standard token functionality from the OpenZeppelin library.
•	@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol - This imports Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) functions for verifying signatures.
•	@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol - This imports safe math operations to prevent overflow and underflow errors.

##Contract Definition:
•	AdvancedBlockchain - This defines a new smart contract named AdvancedBlockchain that inherits functionalities from the ERC20 standard.

## Structs:
•	Miner: Stores information about a miner, including their account address and ID.
•	Transaction: Stores details about a transaction, including sender, receiver, amount, gas details (limit, price, fee), data, and signature.
•	Block: Represents a block in the blockchain, containing its index, timestamp, nonce, previous and current hash, transactions included in the block, and difficulty level for mining.
•	Order: Represents a buy or sell order, including the maker's address, amount, price, and a boolean flag indicating if it's a buy or sell order.
•	Account: Stores information about an account, including its balance, frozen state, last activity timestamp, and rewards earned.

## Variables:
•	nextAccountId: Keeps track of the next available account ID.
•	blockchain: An array storing all the blocks in the blockchain.
•	difficulty: The difficulty level for mining new blocks.
•	buyOrderCount: Tracks the total number of buy orders.
•	sellOrderCount: Tracks the total number of sell orders.
•	owner: The address of the contract owner.
•	nextMinerId: Keeps track of the next available miner ID.

## Mappings:
•	admins: A mapping to store authorized administrator addresses.
•	miners: A mapping to store information about registered miners, linking their address to their miner struct.
•	buyOrders: A mapping to store buy orders by their unique ID.
•	sellOrders: A mapping to store sell orders by their unique ID.
•	accountIdToAccount: A mapping to link account addresses to their corresponding account struct.
•	addressToAccountId: A mapping to efficiently retrieve an account ID for a given account address.

## Modifiers:
•	onlyAdmin - Restricts a function to only be called by authorized admins.
•	onlyOwner - Restricts a function to only be called by the contract owner.
7. Events:
•	LogEvent - An event emitted to log specific data within the contract.

## Constructor:
•	This function is called when the contract is deployed. It initializes some variables, mints an initial token supply to the deployer's address, and sets the contract owner.

## onlyOwner Functions:
•	addAdmin: Grants admin privileges to a new address.
•	removeAdmin: Revokes admin privileges from an address (except the owner).
•	initializeGenesisBlock: Initializes the genesis block (the first block) in the blockchain.
•	adjustDifficulty: Allows admins to adjust the mining difficulty.

## Internal Functions:
•	_addBlock: Adds a new block to the blockchain.
•	_calculateHash: Calculates the hash of a block for verification purposes.
•	getMinerAccountId: Retrieves the account ID associated with a registered miner.
•	getAccountId: Ensures an account exists for an address and assigns a new ID if necessary.
•	EthSignedMessageHash: Used for signature verification within the contract.

## Public Functions:
•	registerMiner: Allows users to register as miners on the network.
•	mineBlock: Enables miners to mine new blocks by adding transactions to the blockchain.
•	validateBlockHash: Checks if a block's hash is valid based on its content.
•	validateBlockchain: Validates the entire blockchain by checking block hashes and their connections.
•	executeTransaction: Allows users to call functions on other contracts by sending a transaction with data.
•	logEvent: Emits a LogEvent event for logging purposes.
•	transferWithSignature: Allows users to transfer tokens with a signature for verification.
•	executeMultiStepTransaction: Enables users to execute multiple transactions in a single call, improving efficiency.
•	placeBuyOrder: Allows users to place buy orders for the token.
•	placeSellOrder: Allows users to place sell orders for the token.
